# calculator
A basic in-browser calculator app created for the The Odin Project.

This project helped me hone my fundamental skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Event listeners and DOM manipulation were central to putting this together. The most difficult part of this project was figuring out the logic for storing and displaying values as the number and operator buttons are pressed.
